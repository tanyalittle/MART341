## COMMENTS IN HTML

### Leaving Messages and Notes in HTML
- Comments in code allow devs to leave info for other human devs only. 
- Comps/processors ignore comments.
- Why include comments in code:
    - **Messages** - Primary comments convey code info; why some code was written a certain way, or info to those collabing on code.
    - **Reminders** - What you are working on. 
    Make notes to yourself about work’s goal or how to go about solving a problem.
    - **TODO** - What else you have to do.Widespread use of comments is to place `TODO:` within code!!!
    ***There are even packages from editors, such as Atom, that can show you a list of your remaining TODO’s in a project or highlight your TODO’s for you to see easily.***
    - **Notes** - To comm intention/thought to HW graders this semester!
    - **Testing** - Turn code snippets on/off by delineating them as comments. Debugging type is useful when hunting for errors/trying diff ways of styling content.



### Adding HTML Comments
- Defined using a tag; browser will ignore anything placed within this tag:
    - `<!-- This is an HTML comment. -->`
- **Some Notes**:
```
<!-- Everything placed between the 'dashes' is part of the comment. -->
<!-- Comments should not span multiple lines in HTML.
        Sometimes this can cause issues for a browser's processor.

        This comment is considered as bad style. -->
<!-- Instead: -->
<!-- You should place each line of a multi-line comment within a comment tag. -->
<!-- That would be considered proper style. -->
```

- Some More Notes:
```
You will be able to see this text. 

<!-- You will not be able to see this text. -->

You can even comment out things in <!-- the middle of --> a sentence. 

<!-- 
Or you can 
comment out
a large number of lines. 
--> 

<div class="example-class"> 
Another thing you can do is put comments after closing tags, to help you find where a particular element ends. <br> 
(This can be helpful if you have a lot of nested elements.) 
</div> <!-- /.example-class -->
```

## ATTRIBUTES

### Review: HTML Elements and Tags
- HTML doc is composed of a tree of HTML elements. 
    - An element is an individual component of an HTML doc. 
    - Elements denote to the processor structure and semantic meaning of the doc. 
    - Elements may be nested or encapsulated within other elements.

>**HTML**
>```
><p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
><p>This is another paragraph element.</p>

>**Result**
><p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
><p>This is another paragraph element.</p>



### Adding Attributes
- **Attributes** provide additional info about HTML element. 
    - Attributes may include languages (US-English vs. French), URL links, picture size, or ways of id-ing elements.
    - Place Attributes inside opening tag of element they refer. 
    - Attributes always provide a `key= “value”` pair w/**key** as identifier. 
    - Double quotes surround **value**. 
    - One reason: spaces within attribute’s value. 
    - Attribute will have one space between tag label and attribute and any subsequent attributes.

>**HTML**
>```
><p align="left">This is a paragraph element, made with "<p>" tags.
><br/>
>It will align to the left of its container.</p>

>**Result**
><p align="left">This is a paragraph element, made with "p" tags.
><br/>
>It will align to the left of its container.</p>



### Revisit the Root
- Common attribute **value** is in *root element* (`<html>...</html>`)
    - ISO language code and/or ISO country code:
        - If site indexed as containing content written in “US-style English:”
        - HTML *lang attribute* declares language of Web page or portion of. 
        - Assists search engines/browsers.

>**HTML**
>```
><html lang="en-US">
>  <p>The root element is made with "<html>" tags, with the key="value" pair of lang="en-US".
>  <br />
>  This root attribute states the page is written in US-style English.</p>
></html>



### Improving Document Structure
- One way to improve standard doc structure:

>**HTML**
>```
><!DOCTYPE html>
><html lang="en">
>  <head>
>    <title>My Way-Cool Awesome Site</title>
>    <!-- Meta data and information about your site, not visible to visitors. -->
>  </head>
>
>  <body>
>    <!-- My "Way-Cool Awesome Site" contents, visible to visitors. -->
>  </body>
></html>



**Root Attributes**
- ***Notes:***
    - Providing a lang attribute with a valid language tag on the `<html>` element will help screen reading tech determine the proper language to announce.
    - Including a valid lang declaration on the `<html>` element also ensures that important metadata contained in the page's `<head>`, such as the page's `<title>`, are also announced properly.
    - [Language Codes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp)
- This element includes the global attributes.
    - `manifest`  
        - Specifies the URI of a resource manifest indicating resources that should be cached locally.
    - `version` 
        - Specifies the version of the HTML Document Type Definition that governs the current document. This attribute is not needed, because it is redundant with the version information in the document type declaration.
    - `xmlns`
        - Specifies the XML Namespace of the document. Default value is `"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"`. This is required in documents parsed with XML parsers, and optional in text/html documents.

>**HTML**
>```
><html lang="en">
>...
></html>


>**XHTML**
>```
><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
>...
></html>





**********************





## DECLARING DOCTYPE

### Review: DOCTYPE
- ==***The DOCTYPE declaration should be the first thing in your HTML file; on line 1!!!***==
- **DOCTYPE declaration** tells browser what type of HTML spec site was written with.
    - The declaration is **not** an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.
    - The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is **NOT** case sensitive.

>**HTML**
>```
><!DOCTYPE html>
><!DocType html>
><!Doctype html>
><!doctype html>





***********************





## HEAD ELEMENTS

### TLDR;
>
>==***Chapter Summary***==
>- The `<head>` element is a container for metadata (data about data)
>- The `<head>` element is placed between the `<html>` tag and the `<body>` tag
>- The `<title>` element is required and it defines the title of the document
>- The `<style>` element is used to define style information for a single document
>- The `<link>` tag is most often used to link to external style sheets
>- The `<meta>` element is typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings
>- The `<script>` element is used to define client-side JavaScripts
>- The `<base>` element specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a page


>==***HTML head Elements***==
>- `<head>`	Defines information about the document
>- `<title>`	Defines the title of a document
>- `<base>`	Defines a default address or a default target for all links on a page
>- `<link>`	Defines the relationship between a document and an external resource
>- `<meta>`	Defines metadata about an HTML document
>- `<script>`	Defines a client-side script
>- `<style>`	Defines style information for a document



### Review: The Head
- **Head element**: `<head>`
    - Container for processing info & doc metadata. 
    - Contains high-level info about site.
    - Always comes first within root element. 
    - *Contains thoughts of page.*
- Several elements required in **head element** plus others encouraged to include.
    - They tell browser/processor info about HTML doc: title, author, pub date.


>**HTML**
>```
><!DOCTYPE html>
><html>
>  <head>
>    <!-- Meta data and information about your site, not visible to visitors. -->
>  </head>
>
></html>
>```

### Meta
- **META element** lives inside head & contains info about webpage. 
    - char set
    - page description
    - keywords
    - author
    - viewport settings
- Not visible to *users*, but used by...
    - Browsers to tell how to display content or reload page.
    - Search engines for keywords and time-sensitivity.
    - Other web services.
- Meta is *empty element*
- Most common atts often used together & specify props of entire page: 
    - ‘name’
    - ‘content’
    1. The value of the name attribute is the property you are setting.
    2. The value of the content attribute is the value that you want to give to this property.
- Example: 
    - On second meta line below, name att indicates intention to specify page’s description. 
    - Content att is where description is defined. 
    - Value of name att can be anything.

- Include following meta els in your pages:
    - `charset`
        - **NOTE:** ==Usually first el in head!==
        - Defines char set for page display.
        - UTF-8 (Unicode) covers almost all chars/symbols in world. 
        - Includes original ASCII standard that covers most char symbols.
    - `Description`
        - Contains des of page so search engines understand its meaning. 
        - ==Should be < 155 chars.==
    - `Author`
        - Defines author of webpage.

>**Examples:**
>- **Define the character set used:**
>    - `<meta charset="UTF-8">`
>
>- **Define keywords for search engines:**
>    - `<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">`
>
>- **Define a description of your web page:**
>    - `<meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">`
>
>- **Define the author of a page:**
>    - `<meta name="author" content="John Doe">`
>
>- **Refresh document every 30 seconds:**
>    - `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">`
>
>- **Setting the viewport to make your website look good on all devices:**
>    - `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`

or...

>`<meta charset="UTF-8">`
>`<meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">`
>`<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">`
>`<meta name="author" content="John Doe">`



### Viewport
- **Viewport**: User’s visible area of a web page. 
    - Varies w/device & smaller on mobile.
    - HTML5 lets designers control viewport through meta tag.
    - `<meta>` viewport el controls page’s dimensions & scale.
    - `width=device-width` sets page’s width to follow screen-width of device.
    - `initial-scale=1.0` sets initial zoom level when browser first loads.
        - Include in head els so pages display more appropriately on mobile browsers!
    - ***Include `<meta>` viewport element in all your web pages!!!***

>**HTML**
>```
><!DOCTYPE html>
><html>
>  <head>
>    <!-- Other meta elements -->
>    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
>  </head>
></html>



### Title
- **Title** tag defines title of doc: 
    - describes title in browser toolbar.
    - provides title for page when added to faves.
    - displays title for page in search engine results.
    - Cannot have more than one title element! 
    - **Must** have title el for doc to validate as HTML!

***IMPORTANT! This is the only required element in the head!***

***The content of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.***

>**HTML**
>```
><!DOCTYPE html>
><html>
>  <head>
>    <!-- Other meta elements -->
>    <title>My Way-Cool Awesome Site</title>
>  </head>
></html>



### Link
- **Link** el tells browser about other resources page may need to load. 
- Typically **CSS** or “stylesheets” which dictate how page will appear.
- ==**Note**== 
    - Only requires opening tag.
    - Contains all atts within opening tag. 
    - `link` is empty el.

>**HTML**
>```
><!DOCTYPE html>
><html>
>  <head>
>    <!-- Other meta elements -->
>    <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">">
>  </head>
></html>



### Style
- **Style** el establishes simple style defs in single HTML page w/o linking to external docs. 

>**HTML**
>```
><!DOCTYPE html>
><html>
>  <head>
>    <!-- Other meta elements -->
>    <style>
>      body {background-color: snow}
>      h1 {color: purple}
>      p {color: blue;}
>    </style>
>  </head>
></html>



### Script
- **Script element**: `<script>`
    Defines client-side JavaScripts.
    - The following JavaScript writes `"Hello JavaScript!"` into an HTML element with `id="demo"`:

>**HTML**
>```
><script>
>function myFunction() {
>  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";
>}
></script>



### Base
- **Base element**: `<base>` 
    - Specifies base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a page.
- **Base tag**: `<base>` 
    - Must have either an href or a target att present, or both.
    - Can only be one single `<base>` el in a doc!

>**HTML**
>Specify a default URL and a default target for all links on a page:
>```
><head>
><base href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">
></head>
>
><body>
><img src="images/stickman.gif" width="24" height="39" alt="Stickman">
><a href="tags/tag_base.asp">HTML base Tag</a>
></body>



### Review: Head Elements
- Code below shows excellent example of head tag in an HTML doc!

>**HTML**
>```
><!DOCTYPE html>
><html lang="en-US">
>  <head>
>    <meta charset="UTF-8">
>    <meta name="description" content="A short description...">
>    <meta name="author" content="Your Name">
>    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
>    <title>My Way-Cool Awesome Site</title>
>    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/style.css">
>    <style>
>      body {background-color: snow}
>      h1 {color: purple}
>    </style>
>  </head>
>
></html>

## BODY ELEMENTS

### Review: The Body
- **Body** el has “meat & potatoes” of site:
    - headings
    - paragraphs
    - images
    - hyperlinks
    - tables
    - lists, etc.
- Rendered data by browser & displayed on client's comp.
- Two types of markup used:
    - Structural markup
    - Semantic markup
- ==**Note:** There can only be **one** `<body>` element in an HTML document.==

>**HTML**
>```
><!DOCTYPE html>
><html lang="en">
>  <head>
>    <!-- Meta data and information about your site, not visible to visitors. -->
>    <title>My Way-Cool Awesome Site!</title>
>  </head>
>
>  <body>
>    <!-- My “Way-Cool Awesome Site” contents, visible to visitors. -->
>  </body>
></html>
>```



### Default CSS Settings
- Most browsers will display the `<body>` element with the following default values:

>**Example**
>```body {
>  display: block;
>  margin: 8px;
>}
>
>body:focus {
>  outline: none;
>}```



### Structural Markup
- **Structural markup** embeds *info* about structure of doc. 
- Includes els such as:
    - Headings
    - Paragraphs
    - Breaks
    - Lists
- Guide user visually & provide info about type of content in doc. 
- Used by browser & DOM to understand content of doc. 
    - Browser uses structural markup to assist *screen readers* & other accessibility-based software.

==**Remember?**==
- Most basic of structured docs should include tags id-ing headings & paragraphs. 
    - Used in almost every doc editing app & crucial in authoring web content!

**Headings and Paragraphs**
- **Headings**: `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags 
    - `<h1>` = most crucial heading; *Main Headings*
    - `<h2>` through `<h6>` = *sub-headings*
    - `<h6>` = least important heading
- **Paragraphs**: Any text between par tags `<p>...</p>` = same par. 
- Almost all non-heading text is in par el in web docs.

### Semantic Markup
- **Semantic markup**: Used to reinforce the semantics - or *meaning* - of doc info. 
    - Can place emphasis on a word/phrase
    - ID word as strong 
    - Provide citations/quotations
    - Link to defs
    - Distinguish editorial changes

>**For example:**
>“Known as *Clue* in North America, *Cleudo* is a murder-mystery game based on **strategy** and **deduction**. Players make arguments based on their questioning of the perpetrator, location, and method of the crime.”

>**HTML**
>```
><blockquote>“Known as <cite>Clue</cite> in North America, <cite>Cleudo</cite> is a murder-mystery game based on <b>strategy</b> and <b>deduction.</b> Players make arguments based on their questioning of the <u>perpetrator</u>, <u>location</u>, and <u>method</u> of the crime.”</blockquote>
>

>**Result**
><blockquote>“Known as <cite>Clue</cite> in North America, <cite>Cleudo</cite> is a murder-mystery game based on <b>strategy</b> and <b>deduction.</b> Players make arguments based on their questioning of the <u>perpetrator</u>, <u>location</u>, and <u>method</u> of the crime.”</blockquote>





***********************





## SEMANTIC MARKUP

### Bold and Strong
- **Bold element**: `<b>...</b>`
    - Does **not** imply any extra meaning! 
- **Strong element**: `<strong>...</strong>` 
    - Indicates strong importance! 
    - Browser default shows in bold.

>**HTML**
>```
><p>This is a <b>bold</b> element.</p>
>
><p>This is a <strong>strong</strong> element.</p>
>```

>**Result**
><p>This is a <b>bold</b> element.</p>
>
><p>This is a <strong>strong</strong> element.</p>

### Italic and Emphasis
- **Italic element**: `<i>...</i>`
    - Does **not** necessarily imply semantically different meaning! 
- **Emphasis element**: `<em>...</em>` indicates subtle changes in meaning of sentence. 
    - Browser default shows in italic.

>**HTML**
>```
><p>This is an element is in <i>italics</i>, and will appear slanted.</p>
>
><p>This is an element is <em>emphasized</em>, and will also appear slanted.</p>
>```

>**Shown As**
><p>This is an element is in <i>italics</i>, and will appear slanted.</p>
>
><p>This is an element is <em>emphasized</em>, and will also appear slanted.</p>

### Superscript and Subscript
- **Superscript element**: `<sup>...</sup>`
    - Raises text, like date suffixes or mathematical powers.
- **Subscript element**: `<sub>...</sub>`
    - Lowers text, like footnotes, chem/math formulas, fractions such as ^1^/~3~

>**HTML**
>```
><p>This is a the 3<sup>rd</sup> element in this section.</p>
>
><p>You are <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> through this section.</p>
>

>**Shown As**
><p>This is the 3<sup>rd</sup> element in this section.</p>
>
><p>You are <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> through this section.</p>

### Quotes and Blockquotes
- Two common ways for quotations: 
    - **quote tag**: `<q>...</q>`
        - Defines short quotation.
        - Browsers normally insert quotation marks around.
    - **blockquote tag**: `<blockquote>...</blockquote>`
        - Section quoted from another source. 
        - Browsers usually indent blockquote els.

>**HTML**
>```
><q>This is an quote element, good for keeping quotes inline with other paragraph text.</q>
>
><blockquote>
>  Sometimes a quote spans multiple sentences or lines.<br/>
>  Longer quotes are better served in a blockquote element.
></blockquote>

>**Shown As**
><q>This is a quote element, good for keeping quotes inline with other paragraph text.</q>
>
><blockquote>
>  Sometimes a quote spans multiple sentences or lines.<br/>
>  Longer quotes are better served in a blockquote element.
></blockquote>

### Abbreviations and Acronyms
- **Abbreviation element**: `<abbr>...</abbr>` 
    - Defines an abbreviation or acronym, like “Mr.”, “Dec.”, “ASAP”, “ATM”.
    - Marking abbreviations can give useful info to browsers, translation systems, & search-engines.
    - ***Hover your mouse over shortened words to see names expanded!***
    - ==**NOTE**==
        - Previous to HTML5, there was an `<acronym>` tag that is no longer supported. 
        - It is best practice to use `<abbr>` for both abbreviations & acronyms in HTML5.

>**HTML**
>```
><p>You can spell out acronyms using the <abbr title=""> tag.</p>
>
><p>For example, <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.</p>

### Citations
- **Cite element**: `<cite>...</cite>`
    - Defines title of a work (e.g., book, song, movie, TV show, painting, sculpture, etc.).
    - ==**NOTE**==
        - A person’s name is **not** the title of a work.

>```
><p>This is a <cite>cited</cite> element.</p>

>**Shown As**
><p>This is a <cite>cited</cite> element.</p>

### Definitions
- **Definition tag**: `<dfn>`
    - First use of a new term in a doc.
    - Nearest parent of `<dfn>` tag must contain the def/explanation for the term inside the def tag. 
    - Def tags also link to related list of terms elsewhere on page/site.
    - ***Hover your mouse over the terms to see their definitions expanded.***

>**HTML**
>```
><p>The definition element <def title="definition of term">term</def> is a common way of defining terms.</p>

### Addresses
- **Address tag**: `<address>` 
    - Defines contact info for author/owner of doc/article.
    - Text usually renders in italic. 
    - Most browsers add a line break before/after.

>**HTML**
>```
><p>An address element can span multiple lines:</p>
>
><address>
>  The University of Montana<br />
>  32 Campus Dr<br />
>  Missoula, MT 59812
></address>

>**Result**
><p>An address element can span multiple lines:</p>
>
><address>
>  The University of Montana<br />
>  32 Campus Dr<br />
>  Missoula, MT 59812
></address>

### Insert and Delete
- **Delete tag**: `<del>`
    - Defines text deleted from a doc.
    - Browsers normally strike a line through deleted text.
- **Insert tag**: `<ins>` 
    - Defines text inserted.
    - Browsers normally underline inserted text.
- Use `<del>` & `<ins>` to markup updates/mods. 

>**HTML**
>```
><p>If elements are <del>deleted</del> <ins>inserted</ins>, they will have a line through or under them, respectively.</p>

>**Result**
><p>If elements are <del>deleted</del> <ins>inserted</ins>, they will have a line through or under them, respectively.</p>

### Strikethrough
- **Strikethrough tag**: `<s>` 
    - Specifies text that is no longer correct, accurate or relevant. 
    - Before HTML5, this was done with `<strike>`.

>**HTML**
>```
><p>Old information can be <s>crossed out</s> using the strikethrough tag.</p>

>**Result**
><p>Old information can be <s>crossed out</s> using the strikethrough tag.</p>
