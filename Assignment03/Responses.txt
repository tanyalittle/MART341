What is an advantage to using a text editor? 
    It speeds up the code writing process by making it easier to debug. Plus, you can install extensions that take a lot of the guesswork out, such as GitHub Copilot.

Is there an advantage of using a relative vs an absolute URL?
    Sure, it takes up less space, effectively decluttering your code, plus VS Code will offer the filenames as you're inputting the link, making it easier and less prone to error.
